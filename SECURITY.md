# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| CVSS v3.0 | Supported Versions                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 9.0-10.0  | Releases within the last 12 months       |
| 4.0-8.9   | Most recent release                       |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The team and community take all security bugs seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our project. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing security@yourproject.com. You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but historically within a few days.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following details:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Any proof-of-concept code (if applicable)

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, here's what will happen:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and validate the issue
3. **Timeline**: We'll provide an estimated timeline for the fix
4. **Updates**: We'll keep you informed of our progress
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with Bandit, tfsec, and Checkov
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning with Safety and Dependabot
- **Secret Detection**: Pre-commit hooks to prevent credential leaks
- **Code Review**: All changes require review before merging

### Infrastructure Security
- **Terraform Security**: tfsec and Checkov scanning for infrastructure misconfigurations
- **Cloud Security**: Cloud provider security best practices implementation
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege access
- **Encryption**: Data encryption in transit and at rest

### CI/CD Security
- **OIDC Authentication**: Short-lived tokens instead of long-lived secrets
- **Secure Secrets Management**: Environment-based secret access controls
- **Build Security**: Signed commits and verified builds
- **Container Security**: Image vulnerability scanning

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### For Code Contributions
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow secure coding practices for your language
- Run security scans locally before submitting PRs

### For Infrastructure Changes
- Review Terraform plans carefully before applying
- Follow cloud provider security best practices
- Use least privilege access principles
- Document security-related configuration changes

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare patches for all releases still under support
4. Release new versions with the patches
5. Publish a security advisory
